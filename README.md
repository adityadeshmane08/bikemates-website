We are Yashraj and Aditya, proud co-founders of BikeMates, and we warmly welcome you to the future of student commuting. BikeMates is more than just an app — it’s a movement, built by students for students. We believe that every journey should be affordable, safe, and empowering. That’s why we created a platform where college friends can share rides, rent bikes, and travel with freedom and confidence.
This isn’t just about getting from point A to B — it’s about creating a smarter, greener, and more connected campus life. Together, we’re building a community where every ride saves money, every rental adds convenience, and every trip strengthens the bond between students. ✨
Join us in this journey. Welcome to BikeMates — where your ride meets your community, and where every road leads to something bigger. 🚴‍♂️🚴‍♀️💡
